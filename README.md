**Detailed Description:**

In this project, I utilized Power Query in Excel to develop a dynamic dashboard that automatically updates with the latest sales data. The dashboard is connected to a source file containing comprehensive sales-related information. The data transformation process in Power Query involved cleaning, reshaping, and preparing the data for analysis. A custom step using M code was implemented to always fetch the most recent month and the preceding month, facilitating a comparison of month-over-month performance across various metrics.

The key metrics displayed on the dashboard include:

- Monthly Sales: A visualization showing the total sales figures for the latest and prior months, allowing for quick assessment of performance changes.
- Top 5 Products: A chart highlighting the five best-selling products, providing insights into product performance and trends.
- Top 5 Employees: An overview of the top-performing employees based on sales, recognizing key contributors to the company's success.
- Top Customers: A list of the most valuable customers, based on sales volume, helping to identify and focus on key customer relationships.
- The dashboard also features the capability to slice data by different categories, such as product lines, regions, or customer segments. This interactivity allows users to drill down into specific aspects of the data, providing a more detailed understanding of sales dynamics.

The use of Power Query ensures that the dashboard remains up-to-date, with data automatically refreshing to include the latest available information. This project resulted in a robust tool for tracking and analyzing critical sales metrics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the most current data.
